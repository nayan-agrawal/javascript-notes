# Window and this Keyword

The most concise JavaScript program consists of an empty file. However, even in this scenario, the JavaScript engine undertakes several operations. In this case, it still generates the Global Execution Context (GEC), encompassing memory allocation and the execution context.

The JavaScript engine generates an entity referred to as 'window.' This object is established within the global space and encompasses numerous functions and variables. These functions and variables hold a global scope, allowing access from any part of the program. Alongside the creation of the Global Execution Context (GEC), the JS engine also initializes a 'this' keyword that references the window object at the global level. To summarize, the GEC involves the creation of a global object (window) and the 'this' variable.

In various JavaScript engines, the global object's name varies; for instance, it's termed 'window' in browsers, whereas in Node.js, it is identified differently. Nevertheless, at the global level, 'this' is equivalent to 'window.'

When we declare a variable within the global scope, that variable becomes associated with the global object.

```
var x = 10;
console.log(x); // 10
console.log(this.x); // 10
console.log(window.x); // 10
```
